			<h1>Advice for prospective students</h1>
      <p><b>Q: What are your research interests?</b><br>A: I'm interested in systems security, computer
systems, dynamic binary translation, and virtualization. If you want to get an overview of my research
interests, I encourage you to read our <a href="../publications/files/13Oakland.pdf">Eternal War in Memory</a>
paper, or look at some of our past research, e.g., <a href="../publications/files/14OSDI.pdf">CPI</a>, <a
href="../publications/files/13ATC.pdf">memTrace</a>, or <a href="../publications/files/11VEE.pdf">libdetox</a>
papers.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What are you looking for in a graduate student?</b><br/>A: My research interests are in the area
of systems and security, therefore any student is expected to have solid programming skills in low-level
languages like C/C++, detailed knowledge of operating systems as well as compilers, and an intrinsic hacker
approach to approaching challenges and problem solving.</p>
			<p><b>Q: How should I apply for graduate studies?</b><br/>A: Graduate students must apply at Purdue
itself and I encourage you to follow the information on the <a
href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/index.html">Purdue page</a>. You may also send me a short
description of your research interests, your current CV, and any other information you'd like me to know when
you're preparing the application.
			<p><b>Q: I'm interested in a research project, what should I do?</b><br/>A: Great, thanks for your
interest. Feel free to get in contact with me after looking at my research interests. If you are a Purdue
student, send me your details and contact me for an appointment. If you are an outside student, follow the
guidelines on Purdue graduate application above.
