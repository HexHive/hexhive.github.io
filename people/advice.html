			<h1>Advice for prospective students</h1>

      <p><b>Q: What are your research interests?</b><br>A: I'm interested in systems security, computer
systems, dynamic binary translation, and virtualization. If you want to get an overview of my research
interests, I encourage you to read our <a href="../publications/files/13Oakland.pdf">Eternal War in Memory</a>
paper, or look at some of our past research, e.g., <a href="../publications/files/14OSDI.pdf">CPI</a>, <a
href="../publications/files/13ATC.pdf">memTrace</a>, or <a href="../publications/files/11VEE.pdf">libdetox</a>
papers.</p>

      <p><b>Q: What are you looking for in a graduate student?</b><br/>A: My research interests are in the area
of systems and security, therefore any student is expected to have solid programming skills in
low-level languages like C/C++, detailed knowledge of operating systems as well as compilers, and an
intrinsic hacker approach to approaching challenges and problem solving.</p> <p><b>Q: How should I
apply for graduate studies?</b><br/>A: Graduate students must apply at the EPFL
graduate school and I encourage
you to follow the information on the 
<a href="https://phd.epfl.ch/edic/application">EPFL EDIC page</a>. 
Graduate applications are handled centrally and all applicants are evaluated by
the IC graduate admission committee. The committee will carefully evaluate your transcripts, your mission
statement, and your CV.  You can mark specific faculty with whom you are interested to work with.
After the committee has evaluated applications, all faculty can look at the applicant pool and select
the most promising students.  This is the time where we add comments or suggestions and select the
students we want to support for the next term.  Your best strategy would be to communicate with me
about fit and your research interests as you are preparing the application.  There is nothing definitive
we can do <i>before</i> you have applied formally.
<br/>
You may also send me a short description of your research interests, your current CV, and any other
information you'd like me to know when you're preparing the application. When sending an email make
sure that your interests align with the interests in the HexHive research group. You are strongly
encouraged to relate your interests to <a href="../projects">existing research projects</a>.

      <p><b>Q: I'm interested in a research project, what should I do?</b><br/>A: Great, thanks for your
interest. Feel free to get in contact with me after looking at my research
interests. If you are an EPFL student, send me your details and contact me for
an appointment. If you are an outside student, follow the guidelines on EPFL
graduate application above.
