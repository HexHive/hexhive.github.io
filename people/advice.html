			<h1>Advice for prospective students</h1>

      <p><b>Q: What are your research interests?</b><br>A: I'm interested in software security,
systems security, computer systems, compiler-based sanitization, fuzzing, and binary
translation/binary analysis. If you want to get an overview of my research interests, I
encourage you to read some of our <a href="../publications/">recent papers</a>. Make sure that
our research interests overlap.</p>

      <p><b>Q: What are you looking for in a graduate student?</b><br/>A: My research interests
are in the area of software security and systems security, therefore any student is expected to
have solid programming skills in low-level languages like C/C++, detailed knowledge of operating
systems as well as compilers, and an intrinsic hacker approach to approaching challenges and
problem solving.</p> 

      <p><b>Q: How should I apply for graduate studies?</b><br/>A: Graduate students must apply
at the EPFL graduate school and I encourage you to follow the information on the <a
href="https://phd.epfl.ch/edic/application">EPFL EDIC page</a>.  Graduate applications are
handled centrally and all applicants are evaluated by the IC graduate admission committee. The
committee will carefully evaluate your transcripts, your mission statement, and your CV.  You
can mark specific faculty with whom you are interested to work with.  After the committee has
evaluated applications, all faculty can look at the applicant pool and select the most promising
students.  This is the time where we add comments or suggestions and select the students we want
to support for the next term.  Your best strategy would be to communicate with me about fit and
your research interests as you are preparing the application.  There is nothing definitive we
can do <i>before</i> you have applied formally.<br/> 

You may also send me a short description of your research interests, your current CV, and any
other information you'd like me to know when you're preparing the application. When sending an
email make sure that your interests align with the interests in the HexHive research group. You
are strongly encouraged to relate your interests to <a href="../projects">existing research
projects</a>. For example, include a paragraph about the HexHive research project that was most
interesting to you. Include a short summary about that project and why you think it was
interesting.</p>

      <p><b>Q: I'm interested in a research project, what should I do?</b><br/>A: Great, thanks
for your interest. Feel free to get in contact with me after looking at my research interests.
If you are an EPFL student, send me your details and contact me for an appointment. If you are
an outside student, follow the guidelines on EPFL graduate application above.</p>

      <p><b>Q: I'm pumped. What should I do to make sure my email is read?</b><br/>A: Awesome.
Consider that faculty receives several cold contact emails per day and we cannot answer all of
them. Most emails consist of a standard text that is copy pasted to all faculty at a school,
maybe with their research area copy-pasted into the letter. Don't do this. If you want an
answer, write a custom email. Explain why you like the research of a particular professor and
how you fit exactly into their research group. Be specific and include details!  Note that if
you <b>use mail tracking images</b>, I will consider your email SPAM and <b>delete your
email</b> without reading it.</p>
