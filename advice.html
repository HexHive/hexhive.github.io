<h1>Advice for prospective students or interns</h1>


<p><b>Q: What are your research interests?</b><br>

A: I'm interested in software security, systems security, computer systems,
compiler-based sanitization, fuzzing, and binary translation/binary analysis.
If you want to get an overview of my research interests, I encourage you to
read some of our <a href="publications/">recent papers</a>. Make sure that
our research interests overlap. When reaching out, make sure to mention
your interests and how they overlap with our research.</p>


<p><b>Q: What are you looking for in a graduate student?</b><br/>

A: My research interests are in the area of software security and systems
security, therefore any student is expected to have solid programming skills
in low-level languages like C/C++, detailed knowledge of operating systems as
well as compilers, and an intrinsic hacker approach to approaching challenges
and problem-solving.</p> 


<p id="EDIC"><b>Q: How should I apply for graduate studies?</b><br/>

A: Graduate students must apply to our graduate school and I encourage you to follow the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/programs/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-application-guidelines/">EDIC guidelines</a>. 
The EDIC admission committee will carefully evaluate your transcripts, your mission statement, and your CV. 
When applying for the EDIC program, please mark systems or security as your area of interest and list HexHive/Mathias Payer as potential advisers of interest.
This allows me to look at your application as part of the application process.
If you decide to reach out before or during the application process, make sure to highlight your interest in the lab (e.g., by relating to <a href="https://github.com/HexHive/">existing research projects</a>) and <i>discuss the overlap between your interests and our interests</i>.
There is nothing I can do <i>before</i> you have applied formally.
Please mention in your email that you have applied or are preparing your EDIC
application.
<br/></p>


<p><b>Q: What are you looking for in an intern?</b><br/>

A: We are looking for curious interns to join us in the HexHive every summer.
Most of our interns are 3rd or 4th year bachelor students or 1st year master
students. The ideal candidate has a decent systems programming background
(C, C++) and has taken a compiler and security class. Experience to large
software systems such as LLVM and Chromium are definitively a plus but not
required. Having taken security and architecture classes are a plus but not
strictly a requirement. We value curiosity and interest in learning and
research, so convince us that you want to be part of a dynamic team.<br/>

EPFL has an amazing program called
<a href="https://summer.epfl.ch/">Summer@EPFL</a> where all intern applications
are handled in a central place. Apply there, select security and/or systems
as your interest areas, list why you want to join the HexHive in your
motivation statement, and list Mathias as your potential adviser. As
applications are handled in a central place, we cannot handle individual
applications on a per-group basis. To do an internship with us, you must apply
through this program. Only reach out by email <i>after you have applied</i>
at the Summer@EPFL program and reference your application.
</p>


<p><b>Q: I'm interested in a doing a research project at HexHive, what should
I do?</b><br/>

A: Great, thanks for your interest. Feel free to get in contact with me after
looking at my research interests. If you are an EPFL student, check the 
<a href="epflprojects/">list of open student projects</a>. If you are an
outside student, follow the guidelines on EPFL graduate application above.
If you decide to reach out by email, confirm that you have followed the
procedure above and clearly lay out how your research interests overlap those
in the group. Given the many requests, we restrict answers to personalized
emails.</p>


<p id="mscindustry"><b>Q: I'm interested in a MSc project in industry and would like to be
be advised by Mathias, how will this work?</b><br/>

A: Master theses in industry allow you satisfy both the internship requirement
and to do your master thesis at the same time. At times it can be challenging
for students to find an academic adviser. On the flip side, faculty get a lot
of requests to advise such projects, usually way exceeding our availability.
In the HexHive lab we advise several industry master theses each semester. If 
you want to apply, reach out early with a project description, key goals, who
your supervisor at the company is, and a description of your background
including which security classes you have taken at EPFL. As advising requires
time and effort, we apply the following priorization strategy:

<ul>
<li>Students that did a semester project in the lab.</li>
<li>Students working on a research project at a university or research lab.</li>
<li>Students working at a company with a local supervisor that worked with us before.</li>
<li>Lowest priority: anyone else.</li>
<li>Note: <a href="epflprojects/">projects in the lab</a> are always accepted if you get to an agreement with the adviser.</li>
</ul>
</p>
	
<p><b>Q: What are the differences between a PhD in the US and in Europe at EPFL?</b><br/>

A: Glad you asked. Picking your PhD location is an important decision that
depends on many factors. Deciding on doing a PhD is a huge, long term
commitment, not just regarding where you'll spend the next 5 years of your
life but also on what you'll work long term. The adviser-advise relationship
lasts forever. So picking an adviser with whom you can work with is key.
Secondary factors include university ranking (this will position you for future
jobs), environment, and location. The environment in Europe varies a bit and is
often different from the US. EPFL is very similar to US universities but some
differences remain. I've written a
<a href="https://nebelwelt.net/blog/2021/0121-phd_at_epfl.html">blog post about
differences between the US and EPFL to clarify the most common questions in
detail</a>.</p>


<p><b>Q: I'm pumped. What should I do to make sure my email is read?</b><br/>

A: Awesome.	Consider that faculty receive several cold contact emails per day
and we cannot answer all of them. Most emails consist of a standard text that
is copy pasted to all faculty at a school, maybe with their research area
copy-pasted into the letter. Don't do this. If you want an answer, write a
personalized email. Explain why you like the research of a particular professor and
how you fit exactly into their research group. Be specific and include
details and context! Note that if you <b>use mail tracking images</b>, I will consider
your email SPAM and <b>delete your email</b> without reading it.</p>
