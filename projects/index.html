<p><h1>Code-Pointer Integrity and Data Confidentiality</h1>
Ideally, memory safety protects systems against memory corruption attacks. Unfortunately, retrofitting
memory safety to low-level languages results in prohibitive performance overhead. To restrict overhead,
Code-Pointer Integrity restricts memory safety guarantees to code pointers and sensitive data, allowing fast
access to regular data and protecting sensitive data from illegal modification. The Code-Pointer Integrity
property protects applications from control-flow hijack attacks and stops any code reuse attack. Data
Confidentiality, an extension of Code-Pointer Integrity identifies sensitive data (e.g., cryptographic keys) and
protects the confidentiality of this data alongside the control data structures. Data Confidentiality ensures
that vulnerabilities cannot be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from a program and therefore also protects
against vulnerabilities like Heartbleed.</p>

<p><h1>Lockdown</h1>
Compiler-based solutions require a recompilation of software to enforce protection. Unfortunately, we do not
always have access to the source code of a system. Lockdown leverages binary analysis to recover control flow
graphs of an application and enforces Control-Flow Integrity, a well accepted security policy that protects
against code reuse attacks, on legacy, binary-only software at reasonably low overhead. Lockdown is limited
by the precision of the binary analysis but makes attacks against legacy software significantly harder and is a
convincing option for binary-only software.</p>
