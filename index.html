      <p><b>Research overview</b><br/>
In the HexHive group at EPFL, our research focuses on software and systems security. Despite
efforts and improvements in bug discovery techniques, applications will always
have some remaining vulnerabilities that may be exploited by an attacker. 
We target techniques that enable developers to discover and remove bugs in
software systems as well as making programs resilient against the exploitation
of unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities.
<br/><br/>

To discover bugs we propose (i) sanitization techniques that enforce a security
property such as memory or type safety; given concrete program input, our
sanitizers then flag any property violations and (ii) fuzzing techniques that
leverage static and dynamic analysis to create program inputs to explore program
areas that are not yet covered through existing test cases.
To protect against exploitable vulnerabilities, we focus on control-flow
integrity using specific language semantics, enforcing type integrity, and
protecting selective data.
<br/><br/>

Under this premise, we focus on compiler-based, runtime-based, and
language-based protection mechanisms and security policies that increase the
resilience of applications against attacks (in the presence of software
vulnerabilities).
<br/><br/>

The current focus of the group, with several active research projects, is
enforcing memory safety guarantees and type safety guarantees at the compiler
and runtime level. All prototypes are released as <a
